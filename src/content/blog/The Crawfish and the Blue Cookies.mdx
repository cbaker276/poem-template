Around the Christmas holiday, everyone ends up with cookies, and last year, I ended up with lots of them. Most notably, a set of big blue-frosted Italian cookies. They had been left uneaten after the seasonal sugar rush, and instead of letting them go to waste, I decided they would be best shared with the birds. So I got in my car, went driving, and found a spot to toss them. It was by chance that the place I picked was right in front of someone’s mailbox. How funny I thought it would be when they went to get their mail and asked themselves, “How did these blue cookies get here?”

Unrelated, I was away on a trip with my family. We were leaving a restaurant after a big meal when, in the parking lot, a crawfish passed us by. This was not a beach town, not outside a seafood restaurant, and not where this sort of thing would otherwise be. So it stumped us how a crawfish got all the way there. We asked ourselves, “How did this crawfish get all the way here?” It was then promptly returned to the nearest water source for safekeeping.

Sometimes in life you wonder how things came to be,
And sometimes you wonder how things will end,
But it’s rare to find a story that answers both.
