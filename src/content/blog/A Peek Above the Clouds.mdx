If I could see to the stars  
Through the clouds every night  
I’d wonder the skies  
With my eyes in delight

I’d look to its glory  
Ask each star that’s around  
Of the stories they hold  
From their planets they found

Are there people up there  
That frown just like us  
Or is that time in space  
Just made up of dust

Could they tell the long story  
Of the beginning of me  
Speak for fields of lost flowers  
And the first of the trees

From when they reside  
We are just stars to them  
A moment in time  
Saying hi to a friend

If I could see to the stars  
Through the clouds every night  
Maybe I’d simply  
Just tell them  
Goodnight
