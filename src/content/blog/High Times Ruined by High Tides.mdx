Sadness comes in waves  
Washing over freshly opened wounds with salt water  
Retreating tides only offer a respite of relief  
Relinquishing the sand to be wet when the waves wash in again  
Another day where the sun's speed is not fast enough to dry the sand  
High times ruined by high tides

Storms set to sustain high tides for some time  
No relief for the poor sand left to sit without sunlight under the swells  
Silent and drowning under the weight of the waves  
A peaceful misery  
Shoulder to shoulder, sand stands alone despite being in a sea of itself

So many of us suffer quietly, waiting for the sun again  
Anxiously holding our breath  
Bracing for the wave to rest a rock on top of our only hope for light, low tide  
Sometimes it's hard to see a way out  
When the pressure on top of you is unrelenting  
Understand that the low tide will always come  
Just try your best not to get buried amongst the sea of sand
