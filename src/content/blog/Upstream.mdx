A cup of water with one last drop  
The lonely kernel that didn’t pop  
Near empty lake with one fish left  
All will be gone when it meets an end

A single book collecting dust  
An older truck still making rust  
Forgotten things, remembered last  
No one wants to be left in the past

Be that cup with a million drops  
The bravest kernel that was first to pop  
That empty lake with one fish left  
It swam upstream and found a friend

A rare book resting on a shelf  
Sometimes rust’s a sign of health  
We don’t make new memories  
To forget the past  
But to look back  
And smile at what we had
