Snow settles on the frozen ground  
The sound of flakes falls all around  
A frigid night on winter's hold  
Seek for warmth in tales of old  
A little nook and cup of tea  
Will make a quiet night for me  
First snow of fall, hold it dear  
There will come a day it disappears  
So grab that book and cup of tea  
Make your nook a home for thee  
Seek for warmth in all around  
Enjoy the gift of quiet sounds  
While flakes find their way to ground  
Love your night, there's snow inbound
