<strong>Traction</strong>

When you find yourself  
Spinning your tires  
Don't push harder on the gas

Put something under your wheels

<strong>In Little Things</strong>

Don’t make a chore  
Out of things you once did for fun

Remember where it started  
And why you’re here

<strong>With Patience</strong>

Every day  
Remind yourself  
To be patient

Tomorrow will come in due time  
And it’s not due yet

<strong>Opens Doors</strong>

A door that's cracked  
Is already  
One step closer to being open

--Connor
