Seasons change like passing pages in a book  
Turning and turning  
Page by page  
Day by day  
Chapter by chapter  
Month by month  
Book by book  
Year by year  
Ink filling up each page  
Memories shared together  
This life is a book I just can't put down  
It feels like fiction  
It's too good to be true  
But the only way it would be fiction  
Is if it wasn't with you  
I want us every  
Page  
Day  
Chapter  
Month  
Book  
Year  
One after another  
always turning and turning  
Making a series full of memories  
One word at a time

--Connor
