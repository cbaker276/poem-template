There's so much truth in those around us  
I can't love someone like me  
People say that I’m a liar  
But doesn't everyone have teeth

There's so much truth in those around us  
As long as you don't look that deep  
People say that I’m a liar  
But they don't see what's across from me

Everyone thinks they’re a lion  
But I’m counting a field of sheep
