I'm just a guy writing what makes me happy; I hope you can find something somewhere that will do the same for you.

<strong style='color: white; font-weight: bold;'>White</strong> is for when things don't feel right
<strong style='color: yellow; font-weight: bold;'>Yellow</strong> makes smiles stay awhile
<strong style='color: blue; font-weight: bold;'>Blue</strong> will find you in the gloom
<strong style='color: darkslategray; font-weight: bold;'>Black</strong>, the voids for what's left
