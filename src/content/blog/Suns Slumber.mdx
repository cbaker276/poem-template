The subject of the sunset subset.  
The warmth it brings to life.  
The dimming sky,  
It’s all a lie,  
An excuse for the sun to sleep.

Some would say the sun sets to give us a chance to weep.  
Others would find, that much like this rhyme,  
Everything’s not that deep.  
Until there’s a time the sun doesn’t shine,  
Then we won’t think it’s so meek.  
For when the sun doesn’t rise we’ll come to find,  
That its beauty wasn’t so cheap.
