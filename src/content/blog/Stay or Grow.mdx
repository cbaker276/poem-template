Asking for help  
But there's no one that knows  
The struggle inside  
To stay or to grow

Hurting myself to watch this wash by  
Years that have passed  
My lake has run dry  
I dammed myself up  
In hopes I get better  
I feel like a bird  
That has wings but no feathers  
Fly me away to some land by the sea  
The ocean has water I wish was like me  
For I've dammed up my lake  
Have I dammed me forever  
My waters run dry  
I hope I get better
