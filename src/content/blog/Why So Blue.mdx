The blue sky dissented against the old blue house.  
The blue shutters sounded and swung in the wind.  
The blue raindrops fell and collected in the blue gutters.  
Then finding their way to a blue petal of a flower,  
Before heading to their home in the cold ground.

The blue car drive by the blue house,  
Wiping its blue blades against the windshield to remove the blue rain.  
The blue stream behind the blue house swelling with the introduction of the new blue water,  
Rising past the bank swallowing up all the blue dry rocks.

Just another blue day for the blue house with the blue gutters and the blue shutters,  
By the blue car with the blue blades in front of the blue stream with the blue rocks,  
All accompanied by the cold blue rain.
