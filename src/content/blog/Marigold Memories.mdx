I think of you like marigolds

Looking back on time we’ve spent  
It almost feels you’ve never left  
I still find seeds you’ve dropped behind  
Marigolds of better times

They’ve sprung up more than here and there  
Your marigolds bloom everywhere  
They make it hard to trim the past  
Their yellow seems to ever last

I know you’ve changed and so have I  
Our deepest roots have yet to die  
Do you still remember me  
In marigold-laced memories

Now seasons change as seasons do  
When one begins to fade from view  
The end of winter shows signs of warmth  
Hope for marigolden sun once more
