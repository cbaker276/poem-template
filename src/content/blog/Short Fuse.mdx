Time elapses now  
Warm minutes seem to pass fast  
Burning seconds chasing the endless fuse to the bomb  
“When will it all blow?” said a passerby that wasn’t moving  
“Does it feel like never because you can’t see the end.” I said  
Passing through time like floating bodies  
Sometimes I wonder if I’m just watching my movie called life  
Smiling as wind knocks down the fall leaves but never feeling the grin stain my face  
Chasing new emotions just to make sure I can still feel

Time elapses now  
Burning the midnight oil just to conquer one more “important” deadline  
Numb only lapsing me when I’m fresh in my dreams  
The thing that I was so afraid of is now the only familiar face I have  
Greeting me with the sound of my alarm, bringing me back to my film  
“When will it all blow?” Said the man  
“I know the end is there, and the fuse is swift in its descent.” I said  
Cement shoes laced with the words of forever  
Stuck with the comfort of a routines  
Too big a leap to change  
Too bad I can’t build a bridge with my courage

Time elapses now  
The moon is the only thing older than me,  
I sleep to his sight and wake with the birds singing the sun's song  
Wasting hours to rock just to know I can move  
The scars of a lifetime cut into my body deeper than the wrinkles show  
“When will it all blow?” it said  
“Soon” I responded, not wasting the breath to fiddle more with thought  
Taking in air deep to fill my lungs, not knowing when I won't anymore  
I smile again to remember how it works  
The place I’m going might not exist, but did I ever  
Boom!
