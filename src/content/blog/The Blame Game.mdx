Whose fault is it you got wet?

The droplet of water that fell on your head,  
Or  
The tree that harbored that bit of dread?

Could it be the hand that shook the tree,  
Or  
The wind that guided it to thee?

The cloud that formed in the sky,  
Or  
The body of water that went dry?

The last in the chain  
Is not always to blame.  
For if you look deep enough,  
Responsibility lies not in one,  
But in all.

--Connor
