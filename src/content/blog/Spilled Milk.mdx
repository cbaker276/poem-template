	Spilled Milk They say not to cry over spilled milk But what if it was a big glass, Can I cry then?
	Can I feel the grief tied to the loss of this large liquid? It’s now reached the once clean
	ground. Was it even milk, Or maybe white water? I guess I’ll never know, The stain of this syrup
	failed to reach my pallet. Its spread to the cold linoleum. I’ve always been an optimist, If a
	glass is half full does it spill more? Maybe if it was half gone it wouldn’t have spilled at all.
	It’s deep in the tattered carpet. Who’s to say a hand toppled the beverage, What about an
	earthquake? The shaking ground should take premise over the spreading spill But my eyes still seem
	stuck to this plight. It’s everywhere. Was it even my responsibility? Regardless of the answer, I
	always find myself reaching down To soak up the mess. ---Connor Baker
