Five antiques sat on a shelf all collecting dust
The first of which, a little bike
That has begun to rust
The next in line, a gorgeous shrine
An elephant with tusks
Its ivory true, now in yellow hue
And its gems still warrant lust
The third that’s there, a deck of cards
Only fifty lie inside
The box is torn, each card looks worn
At least they got playing time
The fourth one up, a metal bell
But no ring was left to find
Its ball was lost, a priceless cost
For a thing that’s meant to chime
The last of them, a pretty doll
Missing both its button eyes
Its once rosy cheeks are now faded heat
From years of sunny skies

Rust, dust, yellow tusks
And missing button eyes
Too few cards, box torn apart
And a bell that lost its chime
The thing about these five antiques
That makes them what they are
From timeless worth
A new vintage birth
Has given them their charm
