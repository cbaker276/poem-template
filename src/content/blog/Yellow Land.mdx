The yellow sun  
Over yellow meadow  
With yellow flowers  
Beautiful yellow petals  
A yellow basket filled with yellow honey  
A yellow bee that's humming softly  
Yellow woman with golden eyes  
Yellow heart of older times

Yellow sun over yellow meadow  
Yellow flowers with the pretty petals  
Yellow honey filled yellow basket  
Yellow bees making quiet racket  
I give to you a yellow ring  
Of yellow gold that shines like old  
Will you make me yellow man  
Together, tomorrow's our yellow land
