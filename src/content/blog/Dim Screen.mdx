Sitting broken at my desk  
Screen is on but nothing left  
Chair I’m on has squeaky wheels  
I don’t notice, I’m not here

Broken man like broken chair  
Typing words into the air  
If you can’t relate to me  
That’s ok, just wait and see

Sitting broken at your desk  
Screen is on but nothing left  
Chair you're on has squeaky wheels  
You don’t notice, you’ve disappeared

Your life was lost in that chair  
It’s not your fault, you're barely there  
Don’t waste your time sitting down  
Get up and find there’s more around

Day in and out, a squeaky chair  
Our screen is on, we’re never there  
Clicked away, it’s time to find  
There's more to life than what's online
