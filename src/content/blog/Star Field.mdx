A sea of shine, this starry night  
I love your look of ancient light  
How have you found a path to me  
The smallest man of sand and sea

Oh starry night, you find me here  
Alone, lost, hollowed by fear  
I smile as I gaze on you  
Your light above sees me too

Ancient now, and ancient then  
For ancient days will lie ahead  
Yesterday is past for me  
In days before from memory  
Neither you nor I will see them though  
We're here and now, forever close

You have lost your life today  
Yet in my eyes you will stay  
I have gained the chance to see  
A light, your gift of memories

--Connor
