April showers  
Bring May flowers  
But it feels more to me like  
Worm Weather

“When will it stop?
Its been raining round the clock.  
There's nothing outside but  
Worm Weather.”

Why do they say  
“There's nothing to do”  
When the skies aren't blue in  
Worm Weather?

There's no need to cry  
When plans go awry.  
What's there to hate about  
Worm Weather?

Pick up your boots,  
It's more than a hoot.  
I love when I hear  
“Worm Weather!”

April showers  
Bring May flowers  
So smile more in  
Worm Weather.
