A fresh flower each day  
Is all the beauty you need  
In a world full of people  
Who wilt when they freeze

Find a sun lamp for warmth  
When the sun isn’t there  
Even flowers have thoughts  
That feel human to share

All this is to say  
That even in cold  
Use love as your heat  
Give lots to grow old

--Connor
